Paper: Shibl, A.A., et al. Diatom modulation of select bacteria through use of two unique secondary metabolites. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 117, 27445-27455 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2012088117

## Introduction 

For this project, we addressed a paper by Shibl and colleagues which examined how phytoplankton modulate and control their bacterial community using excreted metabolites. In this paper, they used metagenomics, (meta)transcriptomics, and metabolomics to investigate interactions between the marine diatom _Asterionellopsis glacialis_ and its bacterial consortium. 

To reproduce their work, we proposed to asemble bacterial genomes from metagenomes, analyze differential gene expression during coculture using the metatranscriptomies, and complement the sequence-based -omics results with reanalysis of metabolite mass spectrometry data. This included replicating the data analysis and visualization underlying Figures 1 and 2. Figure 3 illustrates biochemical processes; figure 4 analyzes microscopy data, which is not bioinformatically relevant; figures 5a-c use experimental data, and we chose to skip reanalysis of figure 5d in order to keep our project within a reasonable scope. 

All genomic data is available on NCBI, and totaled about 250Gb of data. Mass spectral datasets are available via the MassIVE database. However, rather than analyzing chromatographic data directly, we chose to use the SI-provided lists of measured compounds (i.e., molecules defined by a mass-to-charge ratio and chromatographic retention time, or mzRTs), which felt more within the bounds of bioinformatics; it seemed that reanalysis of chromatograms would instead tend more towards instrumental chemistry. The relevant lists of mzRTs were contained in two tables, totaling 801 KB.
